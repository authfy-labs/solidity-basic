# What You Will Learn 🚀

In this course, you will learn:

- **Solidity basics:** You will start with the basics of Solidity, learning about variables and how to build a basic calculator contract.

- **Blockchain deployment:** Learn how to deploy your Solidity contracts to a blockchain.

- **Deep dive into Solidity:** You will explore in depth topics like mappings, arrays, structs, require statements, modifiers, and events.

- **Build a Twitter Contract:** Step-by-step, you will build a Twitter contract, adding features like structs, limiting tweet lengths, adding likes, and more.

- **Integrate with a DApp:** You will learn how to integrate your Twitter contract into a DApp.

- **Advanced Solidity concepts:** Towards the end of the course, you will learn about loops, contract inheritance, and contract-to-contract interaction.

- **Final Project:** At the end of the course, you will add user profiles to your Twitter contract, and also add account creation functionality to your DApp.
